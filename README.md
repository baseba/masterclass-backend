## Database Schema

This project uses a normalized relational schema for a course booking platform. Below are the main entities, enums, and relationships:

### Models

- **Professor**: Teacher/owner of courses.
	- Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `bio`, `profilePictureUrl`
	- Relationships: Has many `courses`, manages `slots`.

- **Student**: User who books classes.
	- Fields: `id`, `name`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `phone`
	- Relationships: Can book `slots` via `reservations`, has many `payments`.

- **Course**: Collection of classes.
	- Fields: `id`, `professorId`, `title`, `description`, `isActive`
	- Relationships: Has many `classes`.

- **Class**: Single unit of learning.
	- Fields: `id`, `courseId`, `title`, `description`, `objectives`, `orderIndex`, `basePrice`
	- Relationships: Can be scheduled in multiple `slots`, has many `materials`.

- **Slot**: Scheduled instance of a class.
	- Fields: `id`, `classId`, `professorId`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `modality`, `status`, `minStudents`, `maxStudents`
	- Relationships: Has many `reservations`.

- **Reservation**: Student's booking of a slot.
	- Fields: `id`, `studentId`, `slotId`, `status`, `paymentId`
	- Relationships: Links `student` and `slot`, tracks attendance and payment.

- **Payment**: Records transactions.
	- Fields: `id`, `studentId`, `amount`, `currency`, `status`, `paymentProvider`, `transactionReference`, `createdAt`
	- Relationships: Can cover multiple `reservations`.

- **Material**: Learning resources tied to a class.
	- Fields: `id`, `classId`, `type`, `url`, `accessPolicy`
	- Relationships: Unlocked when student purchases class/course.

### Enums

- `SlotModality`: `group`, `private`
- `SlotStatus`: `candidate`, `confirmed`, `completed`, `cancelled`
- `ReservationStatus`: `pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`, `attended`, `no_show`
- `PaymentStatus`: `pending`, `paid`, `failed`, `refunded`
- `MaterialType`: `guide`, `slides`, `exercises`, `solutions`, `recording`
- `AccessPolicy`: `pre_class`, `post_class`, `no_show_restricted`

### Indexes

- Indexes are added for performance on `studentId`, `slotId`, `status` where relevant.

### Business Rules

- Progressive discounts for multiple class purchases (checkout logic).
- Group slots require quorum to confirm; private slots are confirmed immediately.
- Materials access depends on purchase and attendance.

## Admin API Routes

These routes are available to authenticated admins:

### Authentication
- `POST /admin/login`
	- Authenticate as admin. Returns JWT token.
	- Body: `{ email, password }`

### Professor Management
- `GET /professor`
	- List all professors.
- `GET /professor/:id`
	- Get details of a professor by ID.
- `POST /professor/promote/:studentId`
	- Promote a student to professor. Creates a professor entry from an existing student.
	- Returns 409 if already a professor, 404 if student not found.

### Course Management
### Course Management
- `GET /course`
	- List all courses (with assigned professor and classes).
- `GET /course/:id`
	- Get details of a course by ID.
- `POST /course`
	- Create a new course and assign a professor.
	- Body: `{ title, description, professorId, isActive }`
- `PUT /course/:id`
	- Update a course.
	- Body: `{ title, description, professorId, isActive }`
- `DELETE /course/:id`
	- Delete a course.

## Session (Class) API Routes

Session routes are nested under courses and require authentication (admin or assigned professor):

- `GET /course/:courseId/sessions`
	- List all sessions (classes) in a course.
- `GET /course/:courseId/sessions/:sessionId`
	- Get details of a session by ID.
- `POST /course/:courseId/sessions`
	- Create a new session in a course.
	- Body: `{ title, description, objectives, orderIndex, basePrice }`
- `PUT /course/:courseId/sessions/:sessionId`
	- Update a session.
	- Body: `{ title, description, objectives, orderIndex, basePrice }`
- `DELETE /course/:courseId/sessions/:sessionId`
	- Delete a session.

**Access Control:**
- Admins can manage any session.
- Professors can manage sessions only in their assigned courses.
- Other users receive 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized.

All session routes require a valid JWT in the `Authorization` header: `Bearer <token>`.

All routes (except `/admin/login`) require the admin JWT in the `Authorization` header: `Bearer <token>`.
